# TonyPnode's Tiny URL thingy
Trying to develop a Tiny URL thingy from scratch using as much TDD as possible (OMG is it hard to stick to TDD)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tonypnode/tonyptinyurl.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tonypnode/tonyptinyurl)
### What I want it to do in Version 1:
* Display website with simple interface
* Take a URL as an input
* Store that URL in database
* Return a smaller URL
* When a user navigates to the smaller URL, the website should redirect the user to the full URL

That's pretty much it..

### Future features:
* Provide a "Preview" page to provide info about URL
* Provide a heat map of most used URLs
* Ensure 100% code coverage for tests
* Automate testing with Travis
